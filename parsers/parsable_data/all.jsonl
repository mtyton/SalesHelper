The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\n\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan\napproach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR.\n.\nRoles and Responsibilities: Development, Testing and support.\nSoftware Used: Oracle 9i\n\nOTHER PROJECTS AND REAL TIME TRAINING:\n\nRTRM(Railway Ticketing System Through Mobile)\nA mobile based real time application with many exciting features like checking pnr status, train\navailability, trains between stations etc. This application was done in j2me and it uses weblogic\nas server and MSSQL as the database.\n\nUndergone a mandatory Training on Finance By Oracle Corporation\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBirla Institute Of Technology -  Pilani, Rajasthan\n\n2011\n\nBachelor of Technology in Computer Science\n\nUniversity College Of Engineering, University Of Kerala\n\n2005 to 2009\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nSKILL SET:\n\n\n\nLanguages: Core Java\nFront end\/GUI Tools programming: Adobe Flex, GWT\nDatabase: Oracle 10g\nIDE: Eclipse, FlexBuilder\nFrameWorks: Spring(Basics), MVC frame work\nOperating System: Windows, Linux, Unix","extras":null,"entities":[{"id":155,"label":"position","start_offset":16,"end_offset":36},{"id":156,"label":"position","start_offset":465,"end_offset":485},{"id":157,"label":"position","start_offset":544,"end_offset":559},{"id":158,"label":"position","start_offset":1238,"end_offset":1258},{"id":159,"label":"position","start_offset":2632,"end_offset":2652},{"id":160,"label":"Skill","start_offset":1227,"end_offset":1231},{"id":161,"label":"Skill","start_offset":1233,"end_offset":1236},{"id":162,"label":"Skill","start_offset":1191,"end_offset":1198},{"id":163,"label":"Skill","start_offset":1431,"end_offset":1435},{"id":164,"label":"Skill","start_offset":1450,"end_offset":1453},{"id":165,"label":"Skill","start_offset":2389,"end_offset":2393},{"id":166,"label":"Skill","start_offset":2395,"end_offset":2405},{"id":167,"label":"Skill","start_offset":2627,"end_offset":2630},{"id":168,"label":"Skill","start_offset":2618,"end_offset":2625},{"id":169,"label":"Skill","start_offset":4035,"end_offset":4044},{"id":170,"label":"Skill","start_offset":4668,"end_offset":4672},{"id":171,"label":"Skill","start_offset":4706,"end_offset":4716},{"id":172,"label":"Skill","start_offset":4718,"end_offset":4721},{"id":173,"label":"Skill","start_offset":4732,"end_offset":4738},{"id":174,"label":"Skill","start_offset":4757,"end_offset":4768},{"id":175,"label":"Skill","start_offset":4748,"end_offset":4755},{"id":176,"label":"Skill","start_offset":4781,"end_offset":4787},{"id":177,"label":"Skill","start_offset":4797,"end_offset":4800},{"id":178,"label":"Skill","start_offset":4830,"end_offset":4837},{"id":179,"label":"Skill","start_offset":4839,"end_offset":4844},{"id":180,"label":"Skill","start_offset":4846,"end_offset":4850},{"id":181,"label":"Education","start_offset":4499,"end_offset":4541},{"id":182,"label":"Education","start_offset":4441,"end_offset":4470},{"id":183,"label":"Education","start_offset":4387,"end_offset":4428}],"relations":[]}
